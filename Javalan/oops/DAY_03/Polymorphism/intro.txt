Poly morphism 

Many ways to represent the same thing 




Types of polymorphism


1. compile Time/Static polymorphism
    Achived via method overloading 

    //opertor overloading is not available


    Same name but aruments types and return types ordering an be different 


2. runtime polymorphism 

    Dynamic polymorphism ---> Actived by method overriding 
    child class has the same method in child and the parent class 
    


    //types of the variable it can access is depends upon the left hand side 





parent obj =new child();
    //types of the method which will call actually depends on the object (which is made)
    //this is known as Upcasting 


This is known as overriding


How it happens internally 

Dynamic method Dispath ----> Very important 

we need function in the parent as well as in chidl
