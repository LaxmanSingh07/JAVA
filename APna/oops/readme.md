`Class vs Object`


`Class` is a blueprint of an object. It is a logical entity. It is a collection of data members and member functions. It is a user defined data type. It is a template or prototype from which objects are created. It is a static entity.

`Object` is an instance of a class. It is a physical entity. It is a run time entity. It is a dynamic entity.



```java
class A{
    int a;
    void show(){
        System.out.println("a = "+a);
    }
}

2. Inheritance in java
